        "Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency and dispersion in a dataset. Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Measures of Central Tendency**:\n",
        "   - **Mean**: Outliers can pull the mean in their direction. If you have a high outlier (a very large value), it can inflate the mean, making it larger than the typical values in the dataset. Conversely, a low outlier can drag the mean down.\n",
        "   - **Median**: The median is less affected by outliers because it is not influenced by extreme values. It represents the middle value when the data is ordered. So, a few outliers won't have a strong impact on the median.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Measures of Dispersion**:\n",
        "   - **Range**: Outliers can significantly affect the range. If you have an outlier far from the rest of the data, it can make the range much wider than it would be without the outlier.\n",
        "   - **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation. Since these measures consider the deviation of data points from the mean, outliers, which are often far from the mean, increase the overall variability.\n",
        "   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The IQR, which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3), is less sensitive to outliers than the range. Outliers have less impact on the IQR because it focuses on the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Consider a dataset of salaries (in thousands of dollars) for a group of employees at a company:\n",

        "- Range without the outlier: 50 - 38 = 12\n",
        "- Range with the outlier: 120 - 38 = 82\n",
        "\n",
        "The outlier drastically widens the range.\n",

        "- Standard Deviation with the outlier (rounded to two decimal places): ≈ 31.21\n",

Therefore, it's essential to identify and handle outliers appropriately when conducting data analysis.\n"
