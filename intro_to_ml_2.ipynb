        "\n",
        "In machine learning, overfitting occurs when a model is too focused on the training set and is not able to adapt to new data. This results in the model performing poorly on new samples. Underfitting occurs when the model is not well-tuned to the training set and is not capturing the relationship between input and output well enough. Both overfitting and underfitting cause the degraded performance of the machine learning model .\n",
        "\n",
        "Underfitting occurs when a statistical model or a machine learning algorithm is too simple to capture data complexities. It represents the inability of the model to learn the training data effectively resulting in poor performance both on the training and testing data. In simple terms, an underfit modelâ€™s predictions are inaccurate, especially when applied to new, unseen examples.\n",
