Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. In contrast, unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning is a combination of both supervised and unsupervised learning, where the algorithm learns from a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.\n",

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm tries to find patterns in the data without any prior knowledge of the output variable. In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data.\n",

In unsupervised learning, there is no output variable and the algorithm tries to find patterns in the input variables. In semi-supervised learning, the output variable is known for some of the input variables and unknown for others."
